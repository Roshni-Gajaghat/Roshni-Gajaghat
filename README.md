- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Roshni-Gajaghat
- ğŸ‘€ I enjoy delving into data, uncovering trends and patterns that ultimately contribute to valuable business outcomes.
- ğŸŒ± I believe that the process of learning is never truly finished. The more you acquire knowledge, the more opportunities you have to apply it. 
      Through implementation, questions naturally arise, leading to further learning and growth.
